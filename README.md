# Ghost
Play Ghost against the computer

This is a quick implementation of the word game 'Ghost'

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_%28game%29

Simply type 'python ghost.py' to play

On the hard setting the computer knows all the words in the English dictionary.
On easy it only knows the 10,000 most common words (but it will still correctly check if you have a legitimate word.

Good luck!
